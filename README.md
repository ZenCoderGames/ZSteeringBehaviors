Steering Behaviors in Godot

A simple clean architecture to add AI Characters and Steering Behaviors as components to a scene in Godot.

Currently only works in 2D.

Look at the example scenes in the project to see the setup.

Currently supports the Behaviors:
- Seek
- Pursue
- Arrival
- Offset Pursuit
- Flee
- Evade
- Leave
- Wander
- Containment
- Obstacle Avoidance
- Wall Avoidance
- Path Following
- Flocking

You can combine any of these behaviors together to create cool emergent behavior.
